# summarizer

This program takes a deep learning algorithim and adds a user interface to it. This allows users to take any text whether that be from a url, an article online, or copy-pasted into the textbox, and to immediatly simplify the text that they are looking at. 

In addition to the deep learning algorhtim, there is a GUI that was made by tkinter module to assist in the usage of the program. The GUI features many buttons and other features that make the program much easier to use.
Shown here is a link to the project GUI: https://replit.com/@AdityaSrikanth/textSummarizerAditya?embed=1&output=1

WARNING: When first opening the project the loading time is very long because there are many packages and modules that repl.it must download before the GUI could be displayed. In addition, the GUI takes place in a virtual enviornment and does not have much sample text files to run, once the GUI is up and running. Finally, the repl.it platform is quite slow and is frustrating when using the GUI. 
To allieviate all of that stress, attached below are screenshots of the program at work.
